# Task: SQL for Craft Workshop Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts and outputs for analyzing a **Craft Workshop** dataset using standard SQL operations.

##  Task Description

The objective of this task was to practice core SQL skills using a custom dataset about craft workshops and their participants. SQL operations included filtering, joining, subqueries, aggregates, and creating views â€” all done using an online SQL IDE.

##  Dataset

Two tables were used:

- **`workshops`**: Contains information about each craft workshop including its title, cost, and category.
- **`participants`**: Contains details about participants attending the workshops, such as name, age, country, and the workshop they attended.

## SQL Environment

All queries were executed using an **online SQL IDE** (e.g., [SQL Fiddle](https://sqlfiddle.com), [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com), etc.).

##  SQL Features Demonstrated

- **SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY**: Used to query, filter, and summarize data.
- **JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)**: Demonstrated relationships between workshops and participants.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Applied `SUM()` and `AVG()` to evaluate cost and participation.
- **Views**: Created a view to analyze participant data along with workshop info.
